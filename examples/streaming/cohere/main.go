	   Decade:         1950s
	   Topic:          Birth of AI
	   Description:    The term 'Artificial Intelligence' is coined by John McCarthy at the Dartmouth Conference in 1956, considered the birth of AI as a field. Early research focuses on areas like problem solving, search algorithms, and logic.

	   Decade:         1960s
	   Topic:          Expert Systems and LISP
	   Description:    The language LISP is developed, which becomes widely used in AI applications. Research also leads to the development of expert systems, which emulate human decision-making abilities in specific domains.

	   Decade:         1970s
	   Topic:          AI Winter
	   Description:    AI experiences its first 'winter', a period of reduced funding and interest due to unmet expectations. Despite this, research continues in areas like knowledge representation and natural language processing.

	   Decade:         1980s
	   Topic:          Machine Learning and Neural Networks
	   Description:    The field of machine learning emerges, with a focus on developing algorithms that can learn from data. Neural networks, inspired by the structure of biological brains, gain traction during this decade.

	   Decade:         1990s
	   Topic:          AI in Practice
	   Description:    AI starts to find practical applications in various industries. Speech recognition, image processing, and expert systems are used in fields like healthcare, finance, and manufacturing.
